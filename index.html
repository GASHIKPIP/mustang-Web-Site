					<p class="f_card_ppp">Classic Recreations has been building officially licensed Shelby <br>
					Mustangs for a while, and according to our friends at AUTOMOBILE, <br>

					three more classic Mustangs: the 1969-1970 Boss 302, the 1969-1970 <br>
					Boss 429, and the 1969-1970 Mach 1. These aren't resto-mods, either. <br>
